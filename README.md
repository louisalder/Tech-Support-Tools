# TechSupport-Tools

## About

The software is used to speed up the gathering information element of a technical support ticket. The software extracts machine information such as OS version info, machine specs, installed software, etc. See the below section for full functionality.

The program uses a mix of python libraries, and embedded poweshell scripts to gather the information.

I created the program in 2022 to help speed up workflows in the Technical Support team I was part of at the time. This is no longer being maintained and is provided here as part of my portfolio to showcase a python project. Feel free to explore the code, but please note that it may not be up-to-date with the latest technologies or practices. Company specific information and logos have been redacted.


### What does the software gather? 

The software currently enables the user to easily gather the following quickly:

1. Hardware info, RAM, CPU, etc.
2. OS Version, build etc.
3. Their port configuration.
4. IP configuration: Network Interface Cards, interface metric etc.
5. Hostname
6. Hosts file info (for systems without DNS)
7. Product versions

The information gathered can be tweaked for your use case and extra functionality can be added in.

Regarding product versions, these are gathered through the use of a powershell script. You can add on additional programs for the tool to scan within the DevProject.py document:

`command = "Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\* | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like '*Python*' -or $_.DisplayName -like '*SQL*' -or $_.DisplayName -like '*.NET*'} | Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, InstallDate | Format-Table â€“AutoSize"`

For example, you could add the following into the command: `'$_.DisplayName -like '*DaVinci Resolve*'`



## Commandline Vs. Graphical user interface version

The app has a commandline version and a graphical user interface (GUI) version.
The GUI version was created with CustomTKinter, which easily allowed a light and dark mode, and scaling. Credit to TomSchimansky for the package:

### Commandline version example:
<img width="608" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/831b7044-f4e4-4371-99b1-c23be5184edc" />

## GUI version example:
## Light mode:
<img width="804" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-08 at 18 35 55" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b14d8cce-a335-4d6e-bbe9-1283f3b371ca" />

## Dark mode:
<img width="808" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08581776-6ef1-4308-8330-f42bc76f34ed" />

You can customize the GUI by adding in your own images into the application directory, replacing the existing 'light.png' and 'dark.png'.

For a custom icon, add a .ico file to the application directory, go into the MyGUI.py and uncomment the following code:
`gui.wm_iconbitmap("icon.ico")`

# Pre-Requisites:
1. Windows Operating System
2. Tested with Python 3.10
3. The following PIP Packages: PIL, customtkinter, psutil

Please note: The program may need to be ran as an administrator user if anti-virus software is enabled.

# To compile to EXE:
I previously compiled this code to an executable using auto-py-to-exe. This compiles all the packages which are used with the program. Install it with the below link:
https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/


## Instructions to end user

End user instructions are contained in the product help file. There is a button available to open this in the GUI version of the app.
